      The tree creation API will take nested entries as well.
      If both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree are specified,
      it will overwrite the contents of that tree with the new path contents
       and write a new tree out.

      Parameters

      base_tree - optional string of the SHA1 of the tree you want to update with new data \n
      tree - array of hash objects(of :path, :mode, :type and sha) \n
      tree.path - String of the file referenced in the tree \n
      tree.mode - String of the file mode - one of 100644 for file(blob), 100755 for executable (blob), 040000 for subdirectory (tree), 160000 for submodule (commit) or 120000 for a blob that specifies the path of a symlink \n
      tree.type - String of blob, tree, commit \n
      tree.sha - String of SHA1 checksum ID of the object in the tree
      tree.content - String of content you want this file to have - GitHub will write this blob out and use the SHA for this entry. Use either this or tree.sha
